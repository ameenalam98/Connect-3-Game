Connect 3 Game - C Programming Project:
Welcome to the Connect 3 Game repository! This project is the culmination of our efforts during the previous semester, where we delved into the fascinating world of Programming Fundamentals. The primary goal of this project was to apply and reinforce our understanding of fundamental programming concepts through the creation of an engaging and interactive game. 

About the Game: 
Connect 3 is a classic two-player game where the objective is to connect three of your pieces in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally on a grid. The game board consists of a 7x7 grid, and players take turns strategically placing their pieces to achieve the coveted three-in-a-row victory. It's a simple yet challenging game that puts your strategic thinking and planning skills to the test.
